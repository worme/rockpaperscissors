// Step 2: Write the logic to get the computer choice
// Your game will be played against the computer. You will write a function that randomly returns “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.

// Create a new function named getComputerChoice.
// Write the code so that getComputerChoice will randomly return one of the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.
// Hint: The Math.random method returns a random number that’s greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. Think about how you can use this to conditionally return one of the multiple choices.
// Note: Some learners might think that arrays are necessary for this problem, but they aren’t. If you’re unfamiliar with arrays, don’t worry - they’ll be covered later in the curriculum.
// Test that your function returns what you expect using console.log or the browser developer tools before advancing to the next step.
    function getComputerChoice(){
        /* This function generates a random number from 0 to 2 and returns the corresponding string of either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. */
        let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random()*3);
        if (randomNum === 0) {
            return "Rock";
        }
        else if (randomNum === 1) {
            return "Paper";
        }
        else {
            return "Scissors";
        }
    }

// Step 3: Write the logic to get the human choice
// Your game will be played by a human player. You will write a function that takes the user choice and returns it.

// Create a new function named getHumanChoice.
// Write the code so that getHumanChoice will return one of the valid choices depending on what the user inputs.
// Hint: Use the prompt method to get the user’s input.
// Test what your function returns by using console.log.
    function getHumanChoice(){
        /* This function prompts the player for a number and returns the corresponding choice of either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. */
        let humanChoice = prompt("Enter a number 1-3: ");
        if (humanChoice === "1") {
            return "Rock";
        } else if (humanChoice === "2"){
            return "Paper";
        } else {
            return "Scissors";
        }
    }

// Step 4: Declare the players score variables
// Your game will keep track of the players score. You will write variables to keep track of the players score.

// Create two new variables named humanScore and computerScore in the global scope.
// Initialize those variables with the value of 0.
    let humanScore = 0;
    let computerScore = 0;

// Step 5: Write the logic to play a single round
// Your game will be played round by round. You will write a function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments, plays a single round, increments the round winner’s score and logs a winner announcement.

// Create a new function named playRound.
// Define two parameters for playRound: humanChoice and computerChoice. Use these two parameters to take the human and computer choices as arguments.
// Make your function’s humanChoice parameter case-insensitive so that players can input “rock”, “ROCK”, “RocK”, or other variations.
// Write the code for your playRound function to console.log a string value representing the round winner, such as: “You lose! Paper beats Rock”.
// Increment the humanScore or computerScore variable based on the round winner.
    function playRound(humanChoice, computerChoice){
        /* This function takes the choices made by both players, compares them, and returns a string with the result. */
        
        if (humanChoice === "Rock"){
            if (computerChoice === "Rock"){
                console.log("Tie! Both players chose Rock!");
            } else if (computerChoice === "Paper"){
                console.log("You lose! Paper covers Rock!");
                computerScore++;
            } else {
                console.log("You win! Rock crushes Scissors!");
                humanScore++;
            }
        }
        if (humanChoice === "Paper"){
            if (computerChoice === "Rock"){
                console.log("You win! Paper covers Rock!");
                humanScore++;
            } else if (computerChoice === "Paper"){
                console.log("Tie! Both players chose Paper!");
            } else {
                console.log("You lose! Scissors cuts Paper!");
                computerScore++;
            }
        }
        if (humanChoice === "Scissors"){
            if (computerChoice === "Rock"){
                console.log("You lose! Rock crushes Scissors!");
                computerScore++;
            } else if (computerChoice === "Paper"){
                console.log("You win! Scissors cuts Paper!");
                humanScore++;
            } else {
                console.log("Tie! Both players chose Scissors!");
            }
        }
        
    }

    // Tests:
    // const humanSelection = getHumanChoice();
    // const computerSelection = getComputerChoice();

    // playRound(humanSelection, computerSelection);
    // console.log(humanScore, computerScore)

// Step 6: Write the logic to play the entire game
// Your game will play 5 rounds. You will write a function named playGame that calls playRound to play 5 rounds, keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end.

// Create a new function named playGame.
// Move your playRound function and score variables so that they’re declared inside of the new playGame function
// Play 5 rounds by calling playRound 5 times.
// Hint: When you assign a function call to a variable, the return value of that function is assigned to the variable. Accessing the variable afterward will only provide the assigned value; it doesn’t recall the function. You need to recall the choice functions to get new choices for each round.
// Re-work your previous functions or create more helper functions if necessary. Specifically, you may want to change the return values to something more useful.
// If you already know about loops, you can use them. If not, don’t worry! Loops will be covered in the next lesson.
    function playGame(){
        /* This function is the main game loop.*/
        
        while (humanScore < 5 && computerScore < 5) {
            console.log("SCORE - Human: " + humanScore + " Computer: " + computerScore);
            playRound(getHumanChoice(), getComputerChoice());
        } 
        if (humanScore === 5) {
            console.log("Congratulations, you win the game!");
        } else {
            console.log("Sorry, you lost the game to an inanimate object. Whammy!")
        }
        
    }

    playGame();
